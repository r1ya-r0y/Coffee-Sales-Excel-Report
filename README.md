# Coffee-Sales-Excel-Report
I recently replicated a beginner-friendly Excel portfolio dashboard project. I used a blue base with complementary colors to enhance the visual appeal. A key takeaway from this project is using the date format dd-mmm-yyyy. It's clear and easy to understand, so whenever you get new data, transforming it to this format can help ensure that both you and others can easily interpret and gain insights from it.
